Geometry Playground is a free ruler and compass Java application for multiple geometries. (You will need [Java 1.50](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp) or greater to run it.) To download Geometry Playground, follow the link below. A file named Playground.jar will then appear in your download directory. You can run Geometry Playground by double-clicking this file.

Instructions for Geometry Playground are probably not needed, but here is the general idea:

1.  Choose a geometry by selecting a tab.
2.  Using the menus, choose what you want to do. You probably want to begin with the **Construct** menu.
3.  Once you have chosen what you want to do, instructions for how to accomplish that should appear at the bottom of the screen.

The command to "move stuff around" can be found in the **Manipulate** menu: **Transform** is the command.

There are some **constructions** saved in a .zip file, including some traditional Euclidean constructions and their counterparts in other geometries. Follow this link to download those [constructions](http://www.plu.edu/~heathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground.zip).
