# Geometry Playground
Geometry Playground is a free ruler and compass Java application for multiple geometries.  

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/joshicola/geometry_playground_java/wiki/Instructions#installation-and-launch) to download and launch Geometry Playground.

## Language Translations
Geometry Playground has been translated into [10 Languages](https://github.com/joshicola/geometry_playground_java/wiki/Instructions#languages). To have it in your own language follow the [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for changes to the `source/Messages.properties` file.


## Basic Instructions for Use
Barebones basic instructions for Geometry Playground are listed below:

1.  Choose a geometry by selecting a tab.
2.  Using the menus, choose what you want to do. You probably want to begin with the **Construct** menu.
3.  Once you have chosen what you want to do, instructions for how to accomplish that should appear at the bottom of the screen.

The command to "move stuff around" can be found in the **Manipulate** menu: **Transform** is the command.

More in-depth instructions can be found in the accompanying [wiki pages](https://github.com/joshicola/geometry_playground_java/wiki/Instructions#instructions-for-use).

## Sample Constructions
There are some [**constructions**](Constructions) of some traditional Euclidean constructions and their counterparts in other geometries. These [**constructions**](Constructions) are integrated into this repository.
