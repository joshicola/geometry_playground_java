# Geometry Playground

Geometry Playground is a free ruler and compass Java application for multiple geometries. (You will need [Java 1.50](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or greater to run it.) To download Geometry Playground, follow the link below. Locate the `Playground.jar` in the download directory. Double-clicking the Playground.jar file will run Geometry Playground if the file is both set to "executable" and associated with a Java Runtime Executable. Alternatively, running the following command from a terminal prompt will do the same: `java -jar Playground.jar`.

Instructions for Geometry Playground are probably not needed, but here is the general idea:

1.  Choose a geometry by selecting a tab.
2.  Using the menus, choose what you want to do. You probably want to begin with the **Construct** menu.
3.  Once you have chosen what you want to do, instructions for how to accomplish that should appear at the bottom of the screen.

The command to "move stuff around" can be found in the **Manipulate** menu: **Transform** is the command.

There are some [**constructions**](Constructions) of some traditional Euclidean constructions and their counterparts in other geometries. These [**constructions**](Constructions) are integrated into this repository.

For contributing improvements to Geometry Playground or additional [**constructions**](Constructions), please submit a pull request.  

The original Java version of Geometry Playground is written by [D. Heath](https://github.com/deejHeath) and [J. Jacobs](https://github.com/joshicola).
