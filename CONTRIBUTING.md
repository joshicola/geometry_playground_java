#Contributing

1. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs, add "constructions".
2. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
3. Send a pull request.

## Editing the Messages_<lg>.properties file
Translations are based on editing the `Messages_<lg>.properties` file for two-digit language codes.  Each of the language codes are listed in [Java's Supported Locales](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk8-jre8-suported-locales.html).

To add your language follow the instructions above to include your `Messages_<lg>.properties` file in the pull request (where `<lg>` is the code for your language.)

Use either the `source/Messages.properties` file or the `source/Playground.txt` file as a template.

More explicit instructions are in the [wiki](https://github.com/joshicola/geometry_playground_java/wiki/Instructions#languages).
