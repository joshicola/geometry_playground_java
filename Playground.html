<title>Geometry Playground v. 1.5: free ruler and compass application for multiple geometries</title>
<meta name="description" content="Geometry Playground is a free straightedge (ruler) and compass Java application for multiple geometries: Spherical (on the unit sphere), Projective (also called Elliptic), Euclidean, Hyperbolic (discovered by Bolyai and Lobachevsky), Toroidal (on a torus), Manhattan (also called Taxicab Geometry), and Conical (on a cone).  Most geometries in this application include more than one model, such as the Beltrami Klein, Poincar&#233;, Upper half-plane, and Minkowski Weierstrass models of hyperbolic geometry or the stereographic and Mercator models of spherical geometry.  Particularly useful for discussing alternatives to the Parallel Postulate.  This program is intended for use in math education." />

<center><h1>Geometry Playground v 1.5</h1></center>
<p>Geometry Playground is a free ruler and compass Java application for multiple geometries. (You will need <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp' target='_blank'>Java 1.50</a> or greater to run it.) To download Geometry Playground, follow the link below.  A file named Playground.jar will then appear in your download directory.  You can run Geometry Playground by double-clicking this file.</p>

<p>Instructions for Geometry Playground are probably not needed, but here is the general idea:
<ol>
<li>Choose a geometry by selecting a tab.</li>
<li>Using the menus, choose what you want to do.  You probably want to begin with the <b>Construct</b> menu.</li>
<li>Once you have chosen what you want to do, instructions for how to accomplish that should appear at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
The command to "move stuff around" can be found in the <b>Manipulate</b> menu: <b>Transform</b> is the command.
</p>

<p>Although most features of Geometry Playground are self-explanatory, there are some short (and cheesy) tutorial videos that might help you get started.  They are: 
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground1.swf">Playground1</a>, constructing and moving segments in Euclidean geometry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground2.swf">Playground2</a>, more constructions, this time in spherical geometry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground3.swf">Playground3</a>, measuring distances, areas, etc., and their sums, ratios, etc..</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground4.swf">Playground4</a>, display options: playing with labels, models, and scale.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground5.swf">Playground5</a>, opening and saving files, undoing, and fixing objects.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plu.edu/%7Eheathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground6.swf">Playground6</a>, reflect, rotate, and translate.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There are some <b>constructions</b> saved in a .zip file, including some traditional Euclidean constructions and their counterparts in other geometries.  Follow this link to download those <a href="http://www.plu.edu/~heathdj/java/geom/Playground/Playground.zip">constructions</a>.</p>
